## Overview

In this course, we will define what open source software is, we will go over the history of open source software and what benefits it has provided to the worldâ€™s technology infrastructure over the decades. The course aims to teach you how to work in open source projects productively and gain a lot of benefits from it, and really understand what the advantages are. You will learn about collaboration best practices, and how to encourage diversity in open source projects. We will discuss the different licensing models that are available, as this will help you decide what the best license is for your project. We will talk about methods that are commonly used, such as Continuous Integration, and use of GitHub and other hosting providers as a central meeting place for open source projects, and we will provide some examples of successful open source projects.

This course is elaborated by Jerry Cooperstein has been working with Linux since 1994, developing and delivering training in both the kernel and user space. He has overall responsibility for all training content at The Linux Foundation. During a two decade career in nuclear astrophysics, he developed state-of-the-art simulation software on many kinds of supercomputers and taught at both the undergraduate and graduate level. Cooperstein joined the Linux Foundation in 2009 as the Training Program Director.
